>  Last updated 2022-11-27.


The application was developed in a very short period of time, less than two months. A mobile application and a web application were developed with the design of the database, the design of the digital map, and the provision of the server with the tools and technologies necessary to run the project.
The most important services provided by the postal addressing application: -
* Show postal codes for all buildings.
* Provides the ability to search for a specific zip code.
* post code Determine a path for a specific postal code through the navigation applications available to the user.
* Provides information on postal district boundaries and addressing system areas.
* Provide a Public Zip Code API. This API was used by The electronic commercial register to verify the postal code.

## Tools and technologies used
The most important tools and technologies:


| Tool | Link 
| ------ | ------ 
| QGIS | https://www.qgis.org/en/site/
| PostgreSQL | https://www.postgresql.org/
| PostGIS | https://postgis.net/
| Mapbox | https://www.mapbox.com/
| Flutter | https://flutter.io/
| Laravel | https://laravel.com/

## MapBox
When choosing a basemap, the map box provider was chosen for several reasons, including:
* The ability to modify and control the base map and build special layers using map box studio.
* The digital map is based on an open geographic information database openstreetmap.
* Unstable prices for Google Maps, as happened with the state of Ghana, after Google raised the prices of its services to up to 1400% for some services.


## Comparisons

### _Dubai_
The Emirate of Dubai, in its first update to the application after launching the application for Libya, canceled the route selection service within the application, and it became used in the same way as the application of the State of Libya, and it also canceled the service of using the application in offline mode.

### Million postal codes
In the year 2021, we added and exchanged postal codes for all buildings in Libya, that is, about 300,000 new postal codes were added to the previous 700,000 postal codes that were collected in 2008.
That is, we currently have more than a million postal codes in Libya.

### In second Version
In the second stage, we were going to use a programming language to accommodate a larger number of requests Like
* C# for Backend (Rest API).
* Nextjs TS (Front end).
